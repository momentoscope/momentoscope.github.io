List of terms and abbreviations
===================================

**BAM** = beam arrival monitor, monitors the time when the FEL beam arrives.

**bunch charge** -- the total charge of an electron macrobunch

**CAMP chamber** -- CFEL ASG multipurpose chamber

**DLD** = delay line detector, measures the (x,y) positions of electrons by two pairs of timing difference measurements.

**GMD** = gas monitor detector, measures the intensity of the FEL beam before and after the gas attenuator. It contains the parts before (**GMD_Tunnel**) and after (**GMD_BDA**) the FEL undulator tunnel. Technical details of the detector see `[Tiedke08]`.

**FEL** = free electron laser

**SASE** = self-amplified spontaneous emission

**macrobunch** -- a macroscopic bunch of electrons which can possess substructures (i.e. microbunches). It is the operating unit of a high-gain FEL and also referred to colloquially as a pulse train. Each macrobunch of electrons is tagged by the macrobunch ID.

**microbunch** -- a subunit of a high-gain FEL pulse train due to spatial redistribution and localization of electrons within a macrobunch -- a phenomenon called [micronbunching](http://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/flash/the_free_electron_laser/how_it_works/high_gain_fel/index_eng.html). Each microbunch of electrons is tagged by a microbunch ID. A well-behaving FEL has a stable number of microbunches within a macrobunch, although the total microbunch number can vary between beam time slots due to change in the machine parameters.

**dd** = [dask dataframe](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/dataframe.html) -- a parallelized version of the [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html)

**run number** -- integer label of an experimental run. Every scan shares a single run number.

**file number** -- integer label of a file in an experimental run.
